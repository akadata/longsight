Hobby project to try out webcam image capture using Python,
with a view to astrophotography. Initial aims include doing
image capture under Mac OS X with control of exposure, gain,
white balance etc. Potential medium/long term ambitions may
include doing image alignment/registration and stacking -
combining multiple frames to maximum light collection and
cancel out noise, but also stiching images together (e.g.
for lunar photography) using techniques similar to those for
constructing panoramas.
